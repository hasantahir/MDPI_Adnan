THz systems can now be operated by non-THz experts greatly facilitating research into many potential applications. Due to the non-ionising nature of THz light and its high sensitivity to soft tissues, there is an increasing interest in biomedical applications including both in-vivo and ex-vivo studies. Additionally, research continues into understanding the origin of contrast and how to interpret terahertz biomedical images. This short review highlights some of the recent work in these areas and suggests some future research directions.},

	abstract="Terahertz technology is still an evolving research field that attracts scientists with very different backgrounds working on a wide range of subjects. In the past two decades, it has been demonstrated that terahertz technology can provide a non-invasive tool for measuring and monitoring the water content of leaves and plants. In this paper we intend to review the different possibilities to perform in-vivo water status measurements on plants with the help of THz and sub-THz waves. The common basis of the different methods is the strong absorption of THz and sub-THz waves by liquid water. In contrast to simpler, yet destructive, methods THz and sub-THz waves allow for the continuous monitoring of plant water status over several days on the same sample. The technologies, which we take into focus, are THz time domain spectroscopy, THz continuous wave setups, THz quasi time domain spectroscopy and sub-THz continuous wave setups. These methods differ with respect to the generation and detection schemes, the covered frequency range, the processing and evaluation of the experimental data, and the mechanical handling of the measurements. Consequently, we explain which method fits best in which situation. Finally, we discuss recent and future technological developments towards more compact and budget-priced measurement systems for use in the field.",

	abstract = {We present a novel measurement setup for monitoring changes in leaf water status using nondestructive terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS). Previous studies on a variety of plants showed the principal applicability of THz-TDS. In such setups, decreasing leaf water content directly correlates with increasing THz transmission. Our new system allows for continuous, nondestructive monitoring of the water status of multiple individual plants each at the same constant leaf position. It overcomes previous drawbacks, which were mainly due to the necessity of relocating the plants. Using needles of silver fir (Abies alba) seedlings as test subjects, we show that the transmission varies along the main axis of a single needle due to a variation in thickness. Therefore, the relocation of plants during the measuring period, which was necessary in the previous THz-TDS setups, should be avoided. Furthermore, we show a highly significant correlation between gravimetric water content and respective THz transmission. By monitoring the relative change in transmission, we were able to narrow down the permanent wilting point of the seedlings. Thus, we established groups of plants with well-defined levels of water stress that could not be detected visually. This opens up the possibility for a broad range of genetic and physiological experiments.GlossaryTHzterahertzTHz-TDSterahertz time-domain spectroscopyΔTincrease or decrease of transmissionPWPpermanent wilting point},

	ABSTRACT = {The terahertz (THz) spectra of rapeseed leaves with different water content (WC) were investigated. The transmission and absorption spectra in the range of 0.3–2 THz were measured by using THz time-domain spectroscopy. The mean transmittance and absorption coefficients were applied to analyze the change regulation of WC. In addition, the Savitzky-Golay method was performed to preprocess the spectra. Then, the partial least squares (PLS), kernel PLS (KPLS), and Boosting-PLS were conducted to establish models for predicting WC based on the processed transmission and absorption spectra. Reliable results were obtained by these three methods. KPLS generated the best prediction accuracy of WC. The prediction coefficient correlation (Rval) and root mean square error (RMSEP) of KPLS based on transmission were Rval = 0.8508, RMSEP = 0.1015, and that based on absorption were Rval = 0.8574, RMSEP = 0.1009. Results demonstrated that THz spectroscopy combined with modeling methods provided an efficient and feasible technique for detecting plant physiological information.},

@article{Kim2015,
abstract = {—An approach is proposed for determination of the complex permittivity and permeability of low-loss materials, eliminating half-wavelength resonances occurring in transmission/reflection (T/R) measurements. To this end, we apply time-domain smoothing for removing resonant artifacts from the wave impedance obtained with the conventional T/R method, assuming that we do not have such artifacts in the refractive index. Accordingly, the permittivity and permeability are found from the smoothed wave impedance and conventional refractive index. Our method is validated by measurements for two different low-loss materials, nylon and lithium ferrite, and those results are discussed. Further, results from the present approach are compared to those from the approximate approach derived in our previous work.},

abstract = {In this study, near-infrared hyperspectral imaging was applied to predict the water content of golden pothos (Epipremnum aureum) leaves, after which partial least squares regression (PLSR) analysis was performed to predict their averaged water content. The resulting predictive model was then applied to each single-pixel spectra in order to construct a water content image that could be used to evaluate the model's applicability to the single-pixel spectra through partial least squares score comparisons between the averaged spectra used for calibration and the single-pixel spectra. In the next phase, it was determined that a rebuilt PLSR predictive model based on the averaged spectra of an applicable pixel showed higher prediction accuracy than that of the original model. This study provides effective information about the limitations of prediction mapping and the optimization of pixel selections for better calibrations.},
